### 🚨 Read me!
HackathonManager v3.0.0 is under **heavy** development. It is recommended you wait until that is released before using this application.

HackathonManager will also be following the gitflow workflow with all commits going to the `develop` branch. When v3.0.0 is ready it will be available as a release along with a dedicated v3.0.0 branch.

---

An all-in-one platform for managing hackathon registration & logistics, originally developed for [BrickHack](https://github.com/codeRIT/brickhack.io).

- **Hacker applications:** Enable hackers to apply to your hackathon while providing all relevant information (contact info, school, demographics, etc)
- **MyMLH support:** Streamline the application process when users log in with [MyMLH](https://my.mlh.io/), a common platform for applying to any MLH hackathon. Basic info is pre-filled based on a common application, so hackers don't have to re-type it every time.
- **Admissions & RSVPs**: Facilitate accepting hackers to your hackathon & enable them to RSVP
- **Bus Lists:** Coordinate bus sign-ups during the RSVP process while communicating important information to riders & captains
- **Email communication**: Ensure hackers get consistent, timely information throughout their application process, while enabling your organizing team to communicate important information at any time.
- **Statistics & Visualization:** Surface key analytics about your admissions, distribution of applicants, progress towards attendance, etc.

## Usage

HackathonManager is a standalone web app separate from your regular marketing website/public homepage.

A typical setup would be:

- **brickhack.io** — Marketing site with event info, schedule, sponsors, etc and a button to apply
- **apply.brickhack.io** — HackathonManager deployment to accept hacker applications + host management dashboard

This allows your public marketing site to operate however you want it (e.g. GitHub pages) while HackathonManager lives in an isolated, consistent environment.

HackathonManager makes use of a few different third-party services & Ruby gems:

- [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) + [MyMLH](https://my.mlh.io/) (authentication & attendee identity)
- [Sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq) (background jobs)
- [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com) (email)
- [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3) (resume storage)
- [Chartkick](http://chartkick.com) (management UI charts)
- [Blazer](https://github.com/ankane/blazer) (custom SQL queries, analytics, and charts)
- [Doorkeeper](https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper) (authentication via OAuth for API usage)

## Get Started

**[Deploy HackathonManager for your hackathon &raquo;](https://coderit.org/hackathon-manager/docs/deployment)**

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

## Documentation

Documentation is available at https://coderit.org/hackathon-manager/

Docs are maintained as markdown files in the `docs/` folder, with the website configuration & tooling stored in `website/`.

Doc & website changes are auto-built and deployed via [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/codeRIT/hackathon-manager) once merged into master.

## Commits + Releases

Releases are automatically generated by [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) using commit messages.

Commit messages should follow the standard `type(scope): subject` format. For example:

- `feat: Improve form typography`
- `deploy(heroku): Ensure db:migrate is run after each deploy`
- `fix: Support HTTPS in questionnaire portfolio URL`

For more information, see semantic-release's [how does it work](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#how-does-it-work).

## Local Development

1. Setup Ruby + MySQL for local development

If you don't already have Ruby + MySQL set up, see [this guide by GoRails](https://gorails.com/setup) for pointers.

- Select your computer's operating system & version
- If given the choice, use `rbenv` -- this will ensure a clean, sustainable Ruby dev environment
- SQLite and PostgreSQL steps are optional

2. Clone the repo

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:codeRIT/hackathon-manager
$ cd hackathon-manager
```

3. Install dependencies

```bash
$ bundle install
```

4. Setup databse

```bash
$ bin/rails db:setup
```

5. Start up the server

```bash
$ bin/rails s  # short for bin/rails server
```

6. Visit http://localhost:3000/apply, create an account, and complete an application

7. In another bash window, promote your user to a director

```bash
$ cd hackathon-manager
$ bin/rails c  # short for bin/rails console
# Wait for the console to start...
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.1)
irb(main):001:0> User.last.update_attribute(:role, :director)
```

8. Visit http://localhost:3000/manage and set up the hackathon as needed

_See https://coderit.org/hackathon-manager/ for docs on regular hackathon setup_

### Local Development Utilities

- **Mail View** - Email templates can be previewed at http://localhost:3000/rails/mailers
- **Mail Catcher** - When active, emails will be captured by MailCatcher instead of slipping into a black hole (no emails are ever sent in development). Visit [mailcatcher.me](http://mailcatcher.me/) and follow instructions under "How" to get setup.
- **Guard** - Automatically runs tests based on the files you edit. `bundle exec guard`
- **Coverage** - Test coverage can be manually generated via the `bin/rails coverage:run` command. Results are then made available in the `coverage/` directory.
- **Sidekiq** - Run background jobs (such as emails) and view active & completed jobs. Sidekiq is automatically started with Docker - a dashboard is available at http://localhost:3000/sidekiq (_also available in production_).
